pnfo
====

pnfo allows you to read NFO files with all the glossy ascii-art and color by
using Vim.

You'll need Vim, Lucida ConsoleP (Supports all cp437 chars) and
http://github.com/trapd00r/neverland-vim-theme if you don't plan on using your
own.

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    # make install
